The ABRATools Project
---------------------
ABRATools is a project based out of the University of Nevada-Reno in Reno, Nevada. The project is a senior capstone project for the Spring 2025 CS426 Senior Project class in Computer Science, in collaboration with the Computer Science and Engineering department.
We are a group of students who are passionate about security and compliance in containerized research environments. We are excited to share our tools with the world and hope that they can help you in your research.

Our Mission
------------
ABRA serves as a merged security platform solution, combining a security information and event management (SIEM) system with a management plane. ABRA addresses the high demand for enhanced logging, security auditing, and containerized environment management. The intended audience for ABRA is those who often work in the orchestration of containerized environments --namely systems administration and network administration professionalsâ€“ who are seeking an innovative, streamlined product for remote management.  ABRA is meant to be a platform neutral and easily installable application which will be able to interface with a wide range of containerization platforms such as Podman and Docker. ABRA is aimed towards increasing security through detailed logging and event management across a variety of systems. It is built on open source and widely used applications native in the modern Linux kernel such as eBPF for observability and standard systemd services for running the service across any modern Linux operating system. With easily installable pre-built binaries and standard dependencies such as Podman, Docker, Go, Python, and a web-browser, users will be able to administer and monitor a cluster of nodes each holding many independent system containers, easily used on top of standard operating systems used for managing clusters of environments for use in education, research, or high performance computing.
